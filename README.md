# ns-3_RACH
ns-3-based simulations for Random access procedure in LENA, LENA+ and LENA-5G


# Experiment 1
Increased the number of users, concurrently monitoring the resulting total delay

<br />

# Experiment 2
Adjusted the number of preambles available for UEs to select by modifying the configuration parameter "NumberOfRaPreambles" and observed the total delay.

# Experiment 3
Positioned multiple UEs at varying distances. Running the experiment once, we measured the delay for each UE to receive the Random Access (RA) response.
